# User Authentication System with Python

## Overview
This is a lightweight, terminal-based user authentication system that allows users to register (onboarding) and log in securely.

## Features
- **User Onboarding**: Register new users with a valid email and secure password.
- **User Authentication**: Log in with email and password, with secure validation.
- **Password Hashing**: Securely hash passwords using `bcrypt` for safe storage.
- **User Data Storage**: Save registered user information in a JSON file.
- **Password Validation**: Enforce strong password requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
- **Email Validation**: Verify email format using regular expressions.
- **Secure Login**: Authenticate users securely with hashed password verification.
- **Email Authentication**: Send verification emails during registration or for password recovery (requires email setup in `.env`).

## Requirements
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or later
- Intermediate understanding of Python
- Basic understanding of Python functions

## Dependencies
- Python standard libraries: `json`, `re`, `os`, `string`, `random`, `smtplib`, `email`
- External packages:
  - `rich` for terminal styling
  - `bcrypt` for password hashing
  - `python-dotenv` for accessing environment variables (`.env` file)


## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed on your machine. Verify with:

   ```bash
    python --version
   ```
2. Clone the repository :

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/timilehin-code/loginSystem.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd loginSystem
   ```
4. Install the required external packages:

```bash
 pip install rich bcrypt python-dotenv
```


5. Create a .env file in the project root with the following structure:

```env
EMAIL_ADDRESS=yourmail@mail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=yourPassword
```
**Note**:  Ensure the `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive credentials. For Gmail, enable 2FA and use an app-specific password for `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

6. The following dependencies are part of Python‚Äôs standard library and do not require installation:  `json`, `re`, `os`, `string`, `random`, `smtplib`, `email`


## Usage
Ensure python is installed on your computer .

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd loginSystem
   ```
2. Run the main Script
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the terminal prompts to register a new user, log in, or exit the program.
